# React-Popsicles
This app is inspired by my work at FullStackAcademy as part of the instructional team. I thought back to a teaching technique used in lower grade levels of pulling names out of a cup written on popsicle sticks for encouraging participation. This site lets you build and save numerous rosters to later randomly draw and remove names from the "cup".
It consists of an API server to perform CRUD operations with the mondogb database as well as the front end application.
